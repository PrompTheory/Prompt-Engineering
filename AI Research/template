Quick Tips:

Write in chunks - don't try to complete sections in order
Start with methods - often the easiest section to write first
Use active voice when possible ("We analyzed" vs "Data was analyzed")
Show, don't just tell - include specific examples, quotes, and data
Get feedback early - share drafts with peers, advisors, writing center

Target Length: 15-25 pages (double-spaced) for most undergraduate research papersAdd to Conversation946
