A big rock floor of something that reacts with sodium from sweat have the people exercise in the room have the sweat dripped down on the rock and harvest the energy from the top of the room

Here's how you could redesign this concept into a **workable wearable energy harvesting system**:

## "Bioelectric Sweat-Powered Generator"

### Core Design
**Galvanic Cells in Footwear**: Embed small chambers containing specific mineral electrodes (like zinc and copper compounds) in shoe soles. As you walk, sweat from your feet creates a saltwater electrolyte solution.

### How It Actually Works

**Electrochemical Reaction**: The sodium chloride in sweat acts as an electrolyte, enabling ion flow between dissimilar metal electrodes. This creates a galvanic cell - essentially a biological battery.

**Mechanical Enhancement**: Walking motion serves dual purposes:
- Pumps fresh sweat through the system
- Activates piezoelectric elements for additional power generation
- Mixes the electrolyte for better conductivity

**Power Management**: Multiple small cells connected in series/parallel provide enough voltage and current for low-power devices.

### Realistic Applications

**Micro-Power Devices**: 
- LED safety lights in shoes
- Fitness trackers
- Emergency beacon transmitters
- Medical monitoring sensors

**Power Output**: Realistically expect 1-10 milliwatts - enough for small electronics but not motors or batteries.

### Key Improvements Over Original Concept

- **Fuel Source**: Uses renewable human sweat instead of finite rock reactions
- **Efficient Scale**: Targets appropriate low-power applications
- **Practical Integration**: Built into existing wearables
- **Maintenance**: Replaceable electrode cartridges when minerals are depleted

This transforms an impossible perpetual motion machine into a legitimate body-powered energy harvesting system that could actually be engineered and manufactured.

## "Kinetic Hammer Generator"

### Simple Design
**Hammer with Built-in Generator**: A modified hammer containing a small generator mechanism that converts your hammering motion directly into electrical energy.

### Core Components

**Electromagnetic Coil System**: 
- Copper coils wrapped around magnets inside the hammer handle
- Each hammer strike moves the magnets through the coils
- This generates electrical current (basic electromagnetic induction)

**Energy Storage**: Small capacitor or rechargeable battery built into the handle stores the generated electricity

**Power Output**: LED lights, small radio, or phone charging port integrated into the hammer

### How It Works

1. **Strike the Rock**: Your kinetic energy transfers through the hammer
2. **Internal Motion**: Impact causes magnets to move rapidly through coils
3. **Electricity Generated**: Moving magnets create electrical current
4. **Power Storage**: Energy accumulates in the built-in battery
5. **Use the Power**: Charge devices or power integrated tools

### Realistic Applications

**Construction Sites**: 
- Hammer with built-in LED work light
- Power small tools or devices
- Emergency communication equipment

**Camping/Survival**:
- Generate power for flashlights
- Charge emergency radios
- Power small electronics

### Power Output
- **Per Strike**: ~0.1-1 watt-seconds
- **Sustained Use**: Could generate 5-50 watts during active hammering
- **Stored Energy**: Enough to power LED lights for hours

This is completely feasible - you're essentially turning human muscle power into electricity through simple mechanical motion. No perpetual motion, just efficient energy conversion from your work effort.
