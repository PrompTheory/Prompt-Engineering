Here's how you could redesign this concept into a **workable wearable energy harvesting system**:

## "Bioelectric Sweat-Powered Generator"

### Core Design
**Galvanic Cells in Footwear**: Embed small chambers containing specific mineral electrodes (like zinc and copper compounds) in shoe soles. As you walk, sweat from your feet creates a saltwater electrolyte solution.

### How It Actually Works

**Electrochemical Reaction**: The sodium chloride in sweat acts as an electrolyte, enabling ion flow between dissimilar metal electrodes. This creates a galvanic cell - essentially a biological battery.

**Mechanical Enhancement**: Walking motion serves dual purposes:
- Pumps fresh sweat through the system
- Activates piezoelectric elements for additional power generation
- Mixes the electrolyte for better conductivity

**Power Management**: Multiple small cells connected in series/parallel provide enough voltage and current for low-power devices.

### Realistic Applications

**Micro-Power Devices**: 
- LED safety lights in shoes
- Fitness trackers
- Emergency beacon transmitters
- Medical monitoring sensors

**Power Output**: Realistically expect 1-10 milliwatts - enough for small electronics but not motors or batteries.

### Key Improvements Over Original Concept

- **Fuel Source**: Uses renewable human sweat instead of finite rock reactions
- **Efficient Scale**: Targets appropriate low-power applications
- **Practical Integration**: Built into existing wearables
- **Maintenance**: Replaceable electrode cartridges when minerals are depleted

This transforms an impossible perpetual motion machine into a legitimate body-powered energy harvesting system that could actually be engineered and manufactured.
